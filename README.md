reddit-client-gtk
=================

A GTK reddit client written in rust.

The code is very ugly I know, still trying to learn Rust.

To compile and run simply do "cargo run"

#### Special thanks to

- The RedditGtkClient Project for
    - their nicely written code to have as a reference
    - their chat icon which I reused
